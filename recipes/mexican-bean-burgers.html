<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>These burgers can be baked, grilled, or fried. Great served on a bun with avocado, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 carrot, sliced</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>

    <li>1 pinch chili powder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place carrot into a bowl, and fill with about 1/4 inch of water. Cover with plastic wrap, and cook in the microwave for 2 minutes, or until soft. Drain.</li>
    <li>Mash beans and steamed carrot in a large bowl. Mix in green pepper, onion, salsa, bread crumbs, and whole wheat flour. Season with salt, black pepper, and chili powder. Add flour to create a firmer mixture, or more salsa if the mixture is too stiff. Form mixture into 8 patties, and place on a greased baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray. Fry the patties for about 8 minutes on each side, or until browned and firm.</li>
