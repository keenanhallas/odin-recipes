# odin-recipes

Project goals:

The intention of this project is to practice basic HTML concepts by creating a simple recipe website. Styling may be added at a later date, but for now (as of 8/28/23) this project will contain no CSS.

The goal of this project is simple: solidify a foundational level of HTML knowledge as well as the basics of working with Git before moving further along into the Odin Project curriculum. The skills I will be looking to focus on are:

    - Creating a basic project file structure
    - Creating HTML boilerplate
    - Use of basic HTML elements & their attributes
    - Basic linking between site pages
    - Using absolute vs. relative paths
    - Utilizing images
    - Committing early & often
    - Atomic commits
    - Proper commit message format
    - Deploy website with Github & submit solution
