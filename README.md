# odin-recipes

###Project goals:

The intention of this project is to practice basic HTML concepts by creating a simple recipe website. Styling may be added at a later date, but for now (as of 8/28/23) this project will contain no CSS.

The goal of this project is simple: solidify a foundational level of HTML knowledge as well as the basics of working with Git before moving further along into the Odin Project curriculum. The skills I will be looking to focus on are:

    - Creating a basic project file structure
    - Creating HTML boilerplate
    - Use of basic HTML elements & their attributes
    - Basic linking between site pages
    - Using absolute vs. relative paths
    - Utilizing images
    - Committing early & often
    - Atomic commits
    - Proper commit message format
    - Using exclusively the terminal for file & directory navigation/creation as well as Git


###After-thoughts:

Technically, this is a very simple & straightforward project, with not much to dissect after the fact. I think the biggest benefit was simply the rote repetition of using terminal commands over & over to work with & modify the file structure as well as perform simple Git operations. In contrast with a simple HTML project in a closed-system sandbox, this project was a more engaging way to work with basic HTML and a great first step in becoming more comfortable working in a local dev environment. In other words, moving closer to the way that (I believe) real-world web dev is accomplished.

Another key benefit, as I see it, was the practice working within the common Git workflow. For example, starting to develop the habit of committing early and often, committing small chunks of code that would be easy to review & approve, and writing commit messages in the proper format. In the past, I have had moments where I've been engrossed in what I'm working on, and have forgotten to commit for extended periods of time, leading to large, unfocused, hard-to-review commits. Now, I am trying to be more mindful about developing a healthy Git commit workflow from the very start of this new iteration of my web dev journey.

Lastly, I think this repetition of simple HTML usage is necessary to get these concepts to become ingrained. Even though I would say basic HTML is straightforward conceptually, there are still details to make sure I pay attention to. Because of the relatively simple nature of basic HTML, I think it's perhaps easy to fall into a habit of being a bit less engaged with the code. However, twice I forgot to add the "alt" attribute to my img elements until I caught it a bit later. It's this sort of "easy" concept that is easy to forget when I'm moving fast & feeling confident, and could pop up later to cause issues that will require time searching for a small oversight. This is why I think the repetition is so beneficial with even the most simple of concepts. I believe it is invaluable to develop good habits in writing clean code as well as staying engaged when things seem easy or montonous. I image this approach will continue to be relevant at any stage of my journey as a developer.
